            I’m a freelance UX/UI Designer hailing from Walnut Creek, CA.

            My career started in IT Support and I’ve learned so much about <b>empathizing</b> with the people I help, providing <b>solutions</b> to their plethora of pain points to make their lives easier. 
            
            But that’s not what got me into design...
            
            One day, I was watching Hulu with my girlfriend and I got SO frustrated with trying to navigate through the menus. I kept spewing off things like “Why would they do that?” and “Why is it so hard to just get to the next or previous seasons?”. 
            
            My girlfriend said, “You’re complaining so much. You should just do something about it.”
            
            So, here I am, constantly learning all that I can so I can <b>do something about it</b>. Redesigning Hulu would be really cool but until then, I’m taking on other fun projects!
            
            When I’m not behind a screen designing, I’m most likely behind a screen making a hip-hop beat, editing some pictures I took of cars and landscapes, or shopping for car parts so I can throw more money at the bottomless money-pit I call my Mustang.
